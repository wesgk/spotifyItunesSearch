## Installation

$ npm install

## Usage

Recent changes of the Spotify API makes authentication a requirement for accessing the search endpoints therefore the Spotify song search portion of this app will not work. Additionally, the recent updates seem to have broken the Spotify Library.

To run the iTunes API you'll need to install this [CORS extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)
